# The Sweet Farm Technical Backlog
The technical team's backlog for all work on the farm or associated media

## Overview

This repository's [issue tracker][1] contains a living list of tasks, features, and suggestions from farm members and the technology team. Issues are organized into _projects_, which can be found on the repository's [project page][2]. When creating new issues, there is a protocol one must use to help keep work organized and actionable. Please see the following section for details.

## Getting Started

Have something that needs to get done? Follow these steps to get started.

### Creating An Issue

To start, first [check to see if your issue exists][1]. If it does not, you can [create a new issue][4] in the tracker. When creating your issue, provide a consise title with no embellishments (e.g. don't add `[HIGH PRIORITY]` to the title). In the description, you can go deeper into exactly what you would like done. Github supports drag + drop screenshots, attachments, and special formatting. Check the documentation to learn more about [formatting your descriptions on Github][5].

You might also assign the ticket to one or more owners, though leaving it unassigned is perfectly fine if you're not 100% sure that the assigneee is in fact the right person to own the task.

### Prioritizing and Categorizing

Labels are super important to the organization and priotization of issues in the backlog. Specifically, adding a type and priority to the ticket will help the team quickly ascertain what and when needs to be done.

### Prioritization (Urgency)

Priority labels help determine how quickly something needs to be done. Here are the options available to issue creators:

- `urgency:now` - Resolution as soon as possible
- `urgency:hours` - Resolution in an before the day is over
- `urgency:days` - Resolution in an before the week is over
- `urgency:weeks` - Resolution in an before the month is over

Anything else does not need a priority, since its timeframe is not urgent enough to warrant immediate attention.

### Categorization (Type)

Type labels help quickly enumerate the sort of issue in question. Not all issues are actually problems:

- `type:bug` - Something is broken. Bugs should clearly enumerate expected and actual results. Steps to reproduce bugs are helpful too.
- `type:feature` - Something needs to be built or developed. Features should contain clear specifications and justifications.
- `type:task` - Tasks just need to get done. They're not new things, nor are they broken, they're simply tasks.

### Selecting Your Project

At any given time, there will be multiple projects that the technical team is working on. Issues can be created in [the tracker][1], and then categorized or added to [a project][2] for eventual completion. When thinking through where to organize your issue, first check to see if a project exists that your issue fits into. If not, you're free to [create a new project][3] that suits your needs.
